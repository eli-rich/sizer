# Sizer

Sizer is a fast, efficient file and directory size analyzer written in Go. It provides a clear overview of storage usage by displaying the size of files and directories in a human-readable format. The tool is run using the command `sz`.

## Features

- üìä Lists files and directories sorted by size (largest first)
- üîç Human-readable file sizes (KB, MB, GB, etc.)
- üóÇÔ∏è Works with both individual files and directories
- ‚ö° Parallel directory scanning for improved performance
- üîÑ Real-time progress updates during scanning
- üìÅ Option to include hidden files (dotfiles)
- üìù Shows total size and file count for scanned directories

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eli-rich/sizer.git
cd sizer
go build -o ./sz
```

## Usage

Basic usage:

```bash
sz [path] [-a]
```

- `[path]`: File or directory to analyze (defaults to current directory if not specified)
- `-a`: Include hidden files and directories (those starting with a dot)

Examples:

```bash
# Analyze current directory
sz

# Analyze a specific directory
sz /path/to/directory

# Analyze a specific file
sz /path/to/file.txt

# Include hidden files
sz -a

# Analyze a specific directory including hidden files
sz /path/to/directory -a
```

## Output Example

For directories:

```
Contents of: /home/user/documents
----------------------------------------
DIR    215.5 MB        projects
DIR    125.3 MB        photos
FILE   25.2 MB         archive.zip
FILE   5.3 MB          report.pdf
FILE   125.0 KB        notes.txt
----------------------------------------
TOTAL: 371.5 MB (324 files)
```

For individual files:

```
File: /home/user/documents/report.pdf
Size: 5.3 MB
```

## How It Works

Sizer first checks if the target is a file or directory:

For individual files:

1. Simply displays the file name and size in a human-readable format

For directories:

1. Immediately processes files at the root level
2. Creates a worker pool to scan subdirectories in parallel
3. Shows real-time scanning progress
4. Aggregates and sorts results by size
5. Displays a summary with total size and file count
